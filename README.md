This is a NestJs backend for my webshop pet projects (Will be linked here). The database for it will be done with mongo, and sql (not sure how i will go about it, i might make it a separate repo along with a docker file, or include it here, and add the instructions on how to use it to this readme). I will create a repository layer, so that the backend would be able to support both types of dbs, and can transition between them with minimal code change.
